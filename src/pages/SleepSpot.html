<p>This concept project came about in conversations with friends: finding a campground
can be a frustratingly daunting process - especially for campers with "non-traditional" sleeping arrangements,
such as van-camping or hammock camping. Sites that welcome these types of campers are frequently independent, and public sites are scattered between
many different agency jurisdicitons. A one-stop source of site listings was a clear opportunity for exploration.
</p>
<h4>Surveying Users</h4>
<p>
  To ensure that the problem was being addressed to meet real campers needs, I created and distributed a Google Survey to identify
  trends in camping styles, usual methods of campsite finding, and barriers to getting out.
  The resulting information confirmed my problem hypothesis ***.
</p>
<h4>Studying the Competition</h4>
<p>
  Data from the user survey steered me towards existing apps and websites for finding campgrounds for competitive analysis.
</p>
<h4>Visualizing the User</h4>
<p>
  I tied together my initial research with the creation of a <strong>user persona</strong> to keep in focus during product development.

    My initial ideas were iterated with pen and paper for speed, and followed up by low-fidelity wireframes in Sketch.
